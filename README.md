> Although written in Chinese, the exercises provided in this book are all available in English statements, most of whom were chosen from ICPC Regionals and World Final(That means these challenges are of high quality and worth practicing). You can submit your solutions on some online judges like [UVA Online Judge](https://onlinejudge.org/) or [ICPC Live Archive](https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8). Some integrated online judging websites, such as [vjudge](https://vjudge.net/), are also recommended.

Most of the solutions will be presented in the form of **C++ code with short tips in the comment**. 

PR welcome! Hope everyone enjoys the process of thinking and solving algorithm challenges!
